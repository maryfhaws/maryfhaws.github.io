                <p>Engram is an AP World History education website that provides informative content, detailed quizzes, and thorough practice essays with feedback. Aiming to provide an engaging experience, Engram was in need of usability research to help increase user retention. This study investigated engagement with Engram using moderated usability testing with eye-tracking, and behavioral analytics data. The website was found to have efficient navigation and effective content overall, but propose improvements to the clarity of its call-to-action and guidance for its essay-writing features.</p>

                <p>Engram's essay-writing section for practicing long essay questions (LEQs) had more views than another other page on the website. This high engagement occurred despite the essay-writing features being the least functional of the website.</p>
                <p>The essay-writing page also had the highest number of u-turns on the site, with 31% of users leaving the page immediately after viewing it. This suggests confusion when regarding the page contents.</p>

                <p><b>We wrote two tasks to investigate this high engagement and high confusion on the LEQ essay page.</b> The tasks captured the different difficulty levels provided by the essays modules, and instructed users to navigate to personalized essay feedback provided by Engram.</p>

                <h3 class="h3-design">Engram's main call-to-action is a top-clicked button, but may be the cause of high u-turns from the essay-writing page</h3>
                <p>“Get Started” is Engram's call-to-action on the homepage. It is a top-clicked button on the website, and it leads to the essay-writing page. We hypothesized that “Get Started” leading users to the LEQ essay page might be the cause of confusion upon reaching that page.</p>

                <h2 class="h2-design">We tried a variety of strategies to screen and recruit participants for our usability tests</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="text-left">
                <p>Our screening questionnaire filtered potential participants based on their age, experience with AP history classes, and their learning/study habits. <b>Our ideal participant was aged 18-22, had taken at least one AP history class, and was a motivated student.</b></p>
                <p>From meeting with the client, we learned that Engram targets motivated students: those who might already use, or be most likely to seek out external resources to help them prepare for the AP exam.</p>

            <img class="img-right" src="design/engram-participant-profile.png" alt="Target participants are aged 18-22, have taken an AP history course, and are/were motivated students">
            <div class="text-left">
                <h3 class="h3-design">How could we gauge which respondents were motivated AP history students?</h3>
                <p>Asking them how many hours per week they spent studying was considered, but was too subjective to measure motivation. We ultimately asked respondents to list the external resources they used while taking AP history, in addition to <b>rating how motivated they felt to learn the AP history material and improve their AP score.</b></p>
            </div>
            <img class="img-right" src="design/engram-motivation.png" alt="Screening question: 'How motivated are/were you to learn the material in your AP course and/or improve your score?' with answer choices from 'very motivated' to 'very unmotivated'">
            <div class="text-full">
                <h3 class="h3-design">We had to adapt recruitment strategies and participant criteria to collect enough data</h3>
                <p>We saw low interest in our study from the target group, likely because we were recruiting in the middle of the semester and required in-person sessions to use the eye-tracking equipment. In order to recruit more participants, we pivoted from our initial recruitment strategy, which included reaching out to undergraduate students via email and social media, to a <b>guerilla-like recruitment process by approaching students on campus.</b> We also loosened our criteria to include slightly older and less-motivated students. A total of 6 participants were tested in our on-campus usability lab.</p>

            <img class="img-wide" src="design/engram-participant-demographics.png" alt="67% of our participants were aged 23-26, and 33% were 18-22; 67% were female, and 33% were nonbinary; 3 had taken AP World History, 4 has taken AP US History, and 1 had taken AP European History; 50% rated themselves as 'very motivated' to learn AP history, 16% rated 'somewhat motivated', 16% rated 'neutral', and 16% rated 'very unmotivated'">

                <h3 class="h3-design">Recruitment setbacks shortened our timeline for data analysis</h3>
                <p>We lost about 10 days of budgeted analysis time, leaving about 2 weeks. We analyzed task performance via success rates and completion times, qualitative data via thematic analysis, and eye-tracking data via heatmaps and gaze replays. Responses to the System Usability Scale, post-task ratings, Google Analytics data, and Hotjar data were also incorporated in our analysis.</p>

Grouping the modules within a common step and <b>applying a consistent button label</b> will make them appear like different levels of essay practice, rather than a mix of tutorials and essay writing.
