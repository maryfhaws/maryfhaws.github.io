            <p class="content">This semester-long project was completed for an information architecture and interaction design course at Pratt Institute. The current NYC Parks website (<a href="https://www.nycgovparks.org/">nycgovparks.org</a>) is due for a redesign because of accessibility, compatibility, and navigation issues. The site is also lacking in aesthetics and displays an overwhelming amount of information at once. Through a series of research and design methodologies, desktop and mobile versions of an updated NYC Parks website were created.</p>
            <p class="content-center">When: September-December 2022</p>
            <p class="content-center">My Role: user research, competitive analysis, sketching, wireframing, prototyping, user testing</p>
            <p class="content-center">Collaborators: Radhika Mehra, Josie Xu, &amp; Yiying Zhou</p>

                <p>Redesign the NYC Parks website to improve its user experience, considering its accessibility, responsivity, navigation, and aesthetics.</p>
                <p>Our problem statement: How might we help people interested in active recreation at NYC's parks find activities suitable for their unique needs and interests?</p>

                <h2 class="art-text-head-center">User Research</h2>
                <h3 class="art-text-subhead">User Group</h3>
                <p>Our research into users of the official NYC Parks website focused on <i>people who regularly engage in active recreation,</i> as this user group was revealed to have significant incentive for visiting the website. Three user subgroups became apparent within the broader fitness-oriented user group: <i>sociable and active young people, middle-aged parents with children, and health-motivated older adults.</i> Because users interested in utilizing the parks for exercise tend to have active lifestyles, they also showed notable interest in events being held at the park. Focusing our research on users who prioritize regular and active recreation will allow for a comprehensive, activity-oriented experience.</p>
                <h3 class="art-text-subhead">Methodology</h3>
                <p>Data Collection: Users were briefly shown the NYC Parks website and asked to share their first impressions of it, and whether they had used it before. <i>Semi-structured interviews</i> consisting of 30 questions, including those for particular subgroups, were conducted, and we probed for additional data as necessary. A total of <i>12 participants</i> were interviewed.</p>
                <p>Data Analysis: <i>Personas and user journey maps</i> were built to explore unmet or unspoken needs of 3 personas representing age-based subgroups with different skills, goals, and frustrations. A user journey map were developed for each persona to breaking down behaviors, emotions, and design opportunities and gain insight into issues with the current interface and potential solutions for our users.</p>
                <h3 class="art-text-subhead">Key Insights</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li><p>Physical and mental health, favorable weather, and quality time with others motivate users to go to parks.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Different age groups tend to correspond with particular activities, interests, and preferences.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Users feel that less is more when trying to find information on a website.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Familiarity with and usage of the current NYC Parks website is low, as users tend to prefer other products and channels.</p></li>

                <h3 class="art-text-subhead">Methodology</h3>
                <p>Card sorting: An audit of the existing NYC Parks website was performed to compile its contents, supplementing and modifying where necessary to reflect the needs of an activity-oriented user group. An <i>open card sorting study</i> with 86 cards was administered to <i>22 paticipants</i> to identify any unintuitive categories on the current site and understand how users conceptualize and categorize the site contents without any structural guidance. The participants also responded to <i>4 pre-study questions</i> regarding basic demographics. <i>Data analysis relied on a spatial visualization of how participants tended to relate cards and dendrograms to assess category agreement and common labeling.</i></p>
                <p>Tree testing: Once the categories and an initial site structure had been determined based on the results of the card sorting study, <i>a tree testing study with 4 scenarios</i> for use of the parks website was implemented. <i>11 participants</i> completed the study and a subsequent <i>unstructured interview</i> to gain insight into any difficulties they had with the task. <i>Measures of success and directness were analyzed to identify common errors and inform a revised site structure.</i></p>

                <p>Wireframes and Iteration: Wireframes were created in multiple phases using Figma. The iterative process allowed for experimentation with ideas from the sketching step, resulting in a refined <i>medium-fidelity prototypes for desktop and mobile</i> that each provided capability for the same <i>two tasks: one in which users perform an advanced search to find an activity (tennis) in a particular location (Manhattan and Central Park) for a group of people (sports team), and another in which users logged into their account to find a saved activity (tennis).</i></p>
                <p>User Testing: <i>11 participants</i> completed user tests consisting of the above tasks on both the desktop and mobile flows. Participants were closely <i>observed as they completed the two tasks using the prototypes.</i> To gain insights into user performance, thought-processes, and difficulties with the design, <i>unstructured follow-up interviews</i> were administered after users completed each task. Observations and participant feedback informed the next iteration of the medium-fidelity wireframes.</p>

                    <p>Most of the feedback from our testing participants was focused on the "Plan Your Visit" page, which features robust filters for detailed advanced searching. Due to the highly detailed search options, participants could not remember all of their selections for the current results, and also wanted a way to quickly adjust their selected filters. To improve the flexibility and efficiency of a user's search on this central page, we added the current selections below the filter dropdowns with the option to remove them directly.</p>
                    <p>Participant feedback was also implemented for the user account and profile navigations, which promoted personalization for park activities. To eliminate confusion with account navigation, we included more meaningful labels for the pages, including "Notifications," "My Events," "Favorites," "Reviews," and "Settings."</p>

                <p>Ideally, our final prototypes for the NYC Parks website could be further tested and validated, in addition to being further developed in all aspects of the site. We focused on the advanced search and profile to reinforce users' goals of finding the right activities for them and personalizing their experience overall. The complexity of our advanced search feature gave me a glimpse into just how complex user needs can be when a product must be designed for such a wide variety of users. Our target group of users engaged in active recreation at the parks was colored with a range of ages, exercise goals, interests, and behaviors that drove our design to be flexible, accessible, and timeless in its visual design.</p>
