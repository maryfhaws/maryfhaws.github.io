                <p>The NYC Parks website (<a href="https://www.nycgovparks.org">nycgovparks.org</a>) is a hub of information and resources for locals and tourists alike. However, the site is due for a redesign because of accessibility, compatibility, and navigation issues. It is also lacking in aesthetics and displays an overwhelming amount of information at once. Through a series of research and design methodologies, desktop and mobile versions of an updated NYC Parks website were created with improved flexibility and aesthetics in mind.</p>

            <div class="text-left">
                <h3 class="h3-design">First, we conducted a card sorting study to inform the site structure</h3>
                <p>We audited the current NYC Parks website to create cards that would capture its key content. Our open card sorting study with 86 cards and 22 participants revealed that <b>the level of specificity with which participant grouped cards varied:</b> some were highly specific groups like “water sports,” while some were more general like “outdoor activities.” <b>About 1/3 of our participants decided to group the cards by personal preference,</b> creating “liked” and “disliked” groups.</p>

            <div class="text-full">
                <h3 class="h3-design">Next, we tree tested a site map based on the results from card sorting</h3>
                <p>A site map was developed based on the most common categories from card sorting. We conducted a tree testing study with 11 participants, but <b>90% of the participants failed to locate information about hiking.</b> Participants were divided on how to approach this task: some looked for parks first, while other search by activity. This behavior revealed that <b>users will have different priorities when navigating the site, suggesting the need to consolidate options.</b></p>

            <img class="img-wide" src="design/nycparks-sitemap.png" alt="two version of the sitemap (before and after tree testing); the later version shows a central advanced search branch">

                <h3 class="h3-design">The final site map centered around an advanced search that would allow for a more personalized experience</h3>
                <p>Because the card sort and tree test revealed that participants varied in specificity, preferences, and priorities, we opted for a search-centric information architecture. <b>The advanced search feature would be the site's core functionality for getting users where they need to go more quickly,</b> and would be immediately accessible from the homepage.</p>

                <p>11 participants completed moderated user tests with our wireframes. They were given the following tasks:</p>

                    <li><p><i>Find tennis courts in Manhattan for your team practice</i></p></li>

                </ul>
                <h4>Finding #1: Participants had trouble remembering their selections when using the search filter drop-downs</h4>
                <p>We improved the advanced search filters by adding a <b>row of filter chips that display a user's current selections.</b> What seems like an obvious finding in retrospect would have been overlooked without user testing.</p>

                <p>This project helped me gain valuable experience in capturing the complexity of user needs and use cases. Because we conducted interviews, a card sorting study, a tree test, and usability tests, I saw how powerful the synthesis of data from multiple sources is in driving a design forward. As a result, I believe our final prototype demonstrates a foundation in user research as well as a commitment to an aesthetic experience.</p>
                <p>The next steps for this project would include validating our final prototype with more user testing; this would allow for further refinement of our flows and interface. We can also explore the workflows and potential designs for the other branches of the site (“Get Involved” for volunteering and “About NYC Parks” for park history) since we mainly focused on park visitors using the “Plan Your Visit” branch for advanced searches.</p>
