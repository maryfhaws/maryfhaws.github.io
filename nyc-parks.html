            <p class="content">This semester-long project was completed for an information architecture and interaction design course at Pratt. The current NYC Parks website is due for a redesign because of accessibility, compatibility, and navigation issues. The site is also lacking in aesthetics and displays an overwhelming amount of information at once. Through a series of iterative and design methodologies, desktop and mobile versions of an updated NYC Parks website were created.</p>

                <h3 class="art-text-subhead">User Group</h3>
                <p>Our research into users of the official NYC Parks website focused on <i>people who regularly engage in active recreation,</i> as this user group was revealed to have significant incentive for visiting the website. Three user subgroups became apparent within the broader fitness-oriented user group: <i>sociable and active young people, middle-aged parents with children, and health-motivated older adults.</i> Because users interested in utilizing the parks for exercise tend to have active lifestyles, they also showed notable interest in events being held at the park. Focusing our research on users who prioritize regular and active recreation will allow for a comprehensive, activity-oriented experience.</p>
                <h3 class="art-text-subhead">Methodology</h3>
                <p>Data Collection: Users were briefly shown the NYC Parks website and asked to share their first impressions of it, and whether they had used it before. <i>Semi-structured interviews</i> consisting of 30 questions, including those for particular subgroups, were conducted, and we probed for additional data as necessary. A total of <i>12 participants</i> were interviewed.</p>
                <p>Data Analysis: <i>Personas and user journey maps</i> were built to explore unmet or unspoken needs of 3 personas representing age-based subgroups with different skills, goals, and frustrations. A user journey map were developed for each persona to breaking down behaviors, emotions, and design opportunities and gain insight into issues with the current interface and potential solutions for our users.</p>
                <h3 class="art-text-subhead">Key Insights</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li><p>Physical and mental health, favorable weather, and quality time with others motivate users to go to parks.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Different age groups tend to correspond with particular activities, interests, and preferences.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Users feel that less is more when trying to find information on a website.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Familiarity with and usage of the current NYC Parks website is low, as users tend to prefer other products and channels.</p></li>

                <h3 class="art-text-subhead">Methodology</h3>
                <p>Card sorting: An audit of the existing NYC Parks website was performed to compile its contents, supplementing and modifying where necessary to reflect the needs of an activity-oriented user group. An <i>open card sorting study</i> with 86 cards was administered to <i>22 paticipants</i> to identify any unintuitive categories on the current site and understand how users conceptualize and categorize the site contents without any structural guidance. The participants also responded to <i>4 pre-study questions</i> regarding basic demographics. <i>Data analysis relied on a spatial visualization of how participants tended to relate cards and dendrograms to assess category agreement and common labeling.</i></p>
                <p>Tree testing: Once the categories and an initial site structure had been determined based on the results of the card sorting study, <i>a tree testing study with 4 scenarios</i> for use of the parks website was implemented. <i>11 participants</i> completed the study and a subsequent <i>unstructured interview</i> to gain insight into any difficulties they had with the task. <i>Measures of success and directness were analyzed to identify common errors and inform a revised site structure.</i></p>

                    <p>Competitive and comparative reviews of 5 other sites were conducted, including state and national park sites and activity- and excursion-oriented sites. The reviews revealed successful and unsuccessful aspects of the sites to inform our design process, the next step of which was to sketch low-fidelity desktop and mobile prototypes.</p>

                <p>Wireframes and Iteration: Wireframes were created in multiple phases using Figma. The iterative process allowed for experimentation with ideas from the sketching step, resulting in a refined <i>medium-fidelity prototypes for desktop and mobile</i> that each provided capability for the same <i>two tasks: one in which users perform an advanced search to find an activity (tennis) in a particular location (Manhattan and Central Park) for a group of people (sports team), and another in which users logged into their account to find a saved activity (tennis).</i></p>
                <p>User Testing: <i>11 participants</i> completed user tests consisting of the above tasks on both the desktop and mobile flows. Participants were closely <i>observed as they completed the two tasks using the prototypes.</i> To gain insights into user performance, thought-processes, and difficulties with the design, <i>unstructured follow-up interviews</i> were administered after users completed each task. Observations and participant feedback informed the next iteration of the medium-fidelity wireframes.</p>
