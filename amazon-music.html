                <p>The goal of the ideation phase was to find a solution that would reconcile our research findings (that users want well-integrated personalization and connectivity features) with Amazon Music's prompt to incorporate emerging technology. We needed to balance the need to innovate with the obligation to reflect the voices of target users in our designs.</p>
                <h3 class="h3-design">We analyzed how competitors integrate personalization, connectivity, and emerging technology into their experiences</h3>
                <p>Personalization, connectivity, and emerging technology were the themes of our exploration and problem, and motivated our choice of competitors for review.

                <p>With our research and competitive analysis in mind, we began to sketch and discuss ideas that might answer our users' needs while also incorporating emerging technology.</p>
                <p>Two concepts became central to our discussion and designs: AI playlist prompts and a social feed.</p>
                <p>Inspired by AI tools like DALL-E and ChatGPT, and by our research finding that personalized playlists are a core feature of music streaming, <b>we imagined a flow in which users could prompt Amazon Music to create a playlist based on desired specifications.</b> These could include a freeform prompt, new vs familiar music, genres, mood suggestions, and length. </p>

            <img class="img-right" src="design/amazon-wireframe.png" alt="wireframe of AI playlist prompt screen">
            <div class="text-full">
                <p>We also explored how AI-generated playlists from personalized prompts, in addition to other content, could be shared with friends on Amazon Music itself. <b>We designed a social feed called “Mix” that would allow users to share content, interact with friends, and get updates from artists.</b> As we wireframed, our flow included a way for AI-generated playlists to be shared to Mix upon creation.</p>

            <div class="text-full">
                <h3 class="h3-design">We conducted moderated user tests with the goal of refining our AI-generated playlist feature</h3>
                <p>6 participants completed a task to create an AI-generated playlist with our wireframes, and answered follow-up questions on their perceptions of the feature and how they might use it in practice.</p>
                <p><b>Overall, the feature was viewed positively, with all of our participants stating that they would love to have it available in their music-streaming service.</b></p>
                <p>The tests also revealed that <b>all participants liked the option to write a freeform prompt, but half of them wanted to see examples.</b> Participants said they felt uncertain as to what they could write as a prompt.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="callout">
                <p class="callout-p"><b>“I would definitely use the prompt because I like to craft playlists with specific vibes.”</b></p>
                <p class="callout-p"><b>“It would be nice to see an example here like '80s music for spicy dinner party.’”</b></p>
            </div>
            <div class="text-full">
                <p>Because participants liked the flexibility of the prompt, but also wanted guidance, <b>they struggled with the initial design that forced a choice between writing a prompt OR using presents for genre, length, and other aspects of their playlist.</b></p>
            </div>
            <div class="text-left">
                <h4>What refinements were made to the designs?</h4>
                <p>Based on these findings, our final design for the AI playlist generator integrated prompt and presets. Presets allowed for flexibility in genres, a mix of new and old music, and playlist length. An example was included below the prompt field, as well as a button to randomly generate a prompt when creative inspiration was needed.</p>
                <p>Our final prototype integrates the AI playlist feature and Mix feed into Amazon Music's existing app. It also features a playlist title and artwork generated by ChatGPT and DALL-E respectively to enhance the AI-generated playlist feature.</p>

                <h3 class="h3-design">A second round of user testing improved navigation to Mix, the new social feed</h3>
                <p>5 participants completed a task to create a public AI-generated playlist, and then view it on their social feed. Follow-up interviews gave further insight into how they navigated and perceived the designs.</p>
                <p>3 of our 5 participants had difficulty locating the Mix feed. This finding revealed a lack of feedback when a public playlist is posted to Mix, especially for a first-time use scenario. A notification badge within the global navigation was not salient enough to accomplish this.</p>
                <p>We incorporated a tooltip for first time use to notify users that their playlist had been posted to the feed.</p>

                <h2 class="h2-design">Future Opportunities & Reflection</h2>
                <p>Future opportunities for personalization in Amazon Music could include prompting new playlists with Alexa and remixing friends' playlists manually or with AI. Avenues for expanding social features might include options to post recommendations or current moods relating to music, commenting on or reposting content from friends, or collaborating on AI-generated playlists with friends. Artist and events updates could grow to include live-streamed or VR events and posting ticket purchases to encourage friends to attend events.</p>
                <p>The major success of this project was that our user testing participants were genuinely excited about our designs. They were eager to provide feedback about how they would use an AI-generated playlist feature, and all expressed that they wished the feature existed on their current music-streaming apps. I appreciated the power in finding a truly representative sample for a user group: participants provided high quality feedback because the designs directly applied to them and their own goals. The quick turnaround for this project also challenged and ultimately improved my time management skills when working with a team.</p>
