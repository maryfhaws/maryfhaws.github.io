            <p class="content">This project was completed for a design sprint hosted by Amazon Music's product team at Pratt Institute. Using generative research methods, we explored users' goals and desires for the future of music-streaming. Our high fidelity prototype, validated with user testing, incoporates an AI-generated playlist feature and a social feed called "Mix" to maximize personalization, delight, and efficiency of use.</p>

                <h3 class="art-text-subhead">Methodology</h3>
                <p>Data Collection: 22 people responded to a survey about music-streaming preferences and behaviors, and we conducted semi-structured interviews with 6 participants.</p>
                <p>Data Analysis: 2 personas were built to explore user needs from social- and artist-oriented perspectives. We represented the goals and pain points associated these 2 subgroups: users who want to share their music with friends, and users who are are looking to attend concerts and get updates from artists.</p>
                <h3 class="art-text-subhead">Key Insights</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li><p>Over 86% of participants would like to share songs and playlists on their music-streaming platform.</p></li>
                    <li><p>81.8% participants would like to get updates from artists on their music streaming platform. Over 60% of participants use social media get updates from artists, with Instagram as the most common platform.</p></li>
                    <li><p>5 out of 6 interviewees felt that personalized playlists and recommendations are essential to their music streaming experience.</p></li>

                    <p>After sketching low-fidelity wireframes and creating medium-fidelity wireframes in Figma, we tested 6 participants with the task of creating an AI-generated playlist and viewing it on their social feed. After completing the tasks, we interviewed participants about their experience with the AI-generated playlist feature and how they would use it. This revealed that flexibility was key: participants wanted to exercise their own creativity while also allowing the AI to help them when they needed ideas or something fresh. As a result, we integrated prompts and presets with customizable options for the playlist's music and length, as well as AI-generated art for the playlist to add a unique feel.</p>
                    <p>We also received feedback about the social feed (Mix), which participants had difficulty locating but found immersive once there. A pop-up was implemented in addition to a notification bubble on the navigation as the playlist was posted to provide additional feedback to users.</p>

                <p>Our design focuses on three main user needs (personalization, social features, and artist/event updates) with AI-generated playlist features and a social feed for artists and listeners. Future opportunities for personalization in Amazon Music could include prompting new playlists with Alexa and remixing friends' playlists manually or with AI. Avenues for expanding social features might include options to post recommendations or current moods relating to music, commenting on or reposting content from friends, or collaborating on AI-generated playlists with friends. Artist and events updates could grow to include live-streamed or VR events and posting ticket purchases to encourage friends to attend events.</p>
                <p>The major success of this project was that our user research and testing participants were genuinely excited about our designs. They were eager to provide feedback about how they would use an AI-generated playlist feature, and all expressed that they wished the feature existed on their current music-streaming apps. We found this feedback encouraging and especially useful given that our participants were highly engaged and passionate about music. From this experience, I appreciated the power in finding a truly representative sample for a user group: participants provided high quality feedback because the designs directly applied to them and their own goals and pain points. The quick turnaround for this project also challenged and ultimately improved my time management skills when working with a team and communicating with stakeholders.</p>
