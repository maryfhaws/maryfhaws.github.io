                <p>Jamba Juice is an American smoothie and juice bar chain that promotes wellness and delight through their products and playful branding. We created a design system called JJ (short for Jamba Juice), including a <a href="https://www.figma.com/community/file/1304863825837849568/jj-ui-kit">UI kit</a> and <a href="https://zeroheight.com/9c2bd2832/p/939dca-jj">documentation website</a>, to improve the consistency and accessibility of Jamba's digital products.

                <p>Jamba's website and brand foster colorful and cheerful experiences. However, <b>the website contains inconsistencies and accessibility issues,</b> suggesting that the company is not using a design system. </p>
                <p>We saw Jamba as a good candidate for a design system that would capture its abundance of fun and colorful elements, while ensuring that they are consistent and accessible.</p>

                <h2 class="h2-design">We created a UI inventory of Jamba's website to identify inconsistent and inaccessible patterns</h2>

            <div class="text-full">
                <h3 class="h3-design">UI elements were collected and categorized</h3>
                <p>Following the <a href="https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/interface-inventory/">guidance of Brad Frost</a>, we screen-captured every element on the Jamba website, pasted the images onto a Figma board, and categorized them. The categories included: <b>colors, typography, headers, buttons, icons, cards, banners, modals, forms, and more.</b></p>
            </div>
            <img class="img-wide" src="design/jj-ui-inventory.png" alt="Jamba.com UI Inventory">
            <div class="text-full">
                <h3 class="h3-design">We identified inconsistencies to improve standardization</h3>
                <p>We examined the UI categories for inconsistencies in their elements, while also considering how they could be <b>standardized as components in a system.</b></p>
            </div>
            <div class="text-left">
                <p>One example of an inconsistency occurs in the modals: they had <b>different text alignments</b> (center vs. left) and <b>various button colors</b> (green vs. yellow) with no clear logic motivating those distinctions. We planned for left-aligned text and green primary buttons in all modals of this type.</p>
                <p><b>Standardizing helped streamline our entire process,</b> as we wanted the components in the system to be <b>easy for users to adopt.</b></p>
            </div>

            <div class="text-full">
                <h3 class="h3-design">We evaluated the accessibility of each element</h3>
                <p>This final step before building the actual design system ensured that <b>the elements would have a foundation in usability and inclusivity.</b> We checked each component using the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/">WCAG</a>. Considering accessibility upfront saved time and reinforced Jamba's values of wellbeing, inclusivity, and efficiency.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="text-left-narrow">
                <p>One example of an accessibility issue that we uncovered was the use of <b>different text styles for a single phrase or sentence</b> in banners. The difference is jarring since it mixes a thin, handwritten font with a bold, sans-serif font. </p>
                <p>Planning to fix this issue and others in our system ensured that <b>accessibility would be built into to our system.</b></p>

                <p>Our UI inventory included all the colors on Jamba's website, which we used to create <b>color ramps for 5 hues with 7 levels of tints and shades.</b> We matched the color variation on the website as closely as possible during this process.</p>

            <div class="text-left">
                <p>With Jamba's brand colors defined, we devised a color token system for JJ, through which <b>colors could be efficiently managed by designers and integrated by developers.</b> We structured the color tokens in 3 levels:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><p><b>Level 1</b> captures the 35 brand colors with their hex codes</p></li>
                    <li><p><b>Level 2</b> contains the colors used in the site, referencing their Level 1 values</p></li>
                    <li><p><b>Level 3</b>  defines the colors used for each type of element using semantic token labels, and referencing their Level 2 values</p></li>

                <h3 class="h3-design">We built flexible components that work seamlessly together</h3>
                <p>To make JJ as effective and efficient as possible, we utilized properties, variants, instance swapping, and auto layout in Figma. This allowed us to make <b>components that are modular, nested, and fit together in a variety of ways.</b></p>

            <div class="text-left-narrow">
                <p>An example of a <b>flexible component in JJ</b> is the slot. Slots make up forms, which can be contained in other components like full page modals.
