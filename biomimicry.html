                <p>This project originated from our shared curiosity in attempting to mitigate environmental harms caused by the digital products we, as designers, work with regularly.</p>

                <p>Researching this problem and its consequences on a deeper level allowed us to reflect on how UX and human-centered design practices, which are inherently anthropocentric, contribute to these issues, and how our design process could undermine the status quo of the tech industry.</p>
                <h3 class="h3-design">The overconsumption of information manifests in high amounts of screen time throughout the world</h3>
                <p>According to <a href="https://datareportal.com/global-digital-overview">research from Data Reportal</a>, <b>the average user around the world spends 6 hours and 35 minutes per day on screens,</b> and the number of internet users steadily increases each year.

                <p>This operating system and its features would benefit human and non-human stakeholders like Clive and Emily. It could help reduce energy usage and land exploitation, directly benefitting Clive and other non-humans. Hibernation mode and low-energy distractions in our system would help human users like Emily manage their consumption. Most importantly, the benefits from more democratic technology (that is, technology that considers the needs of humans and non-humans) are shared among every being on earth.</p>
                <p>Rachel Carson wrote in Silent Spring that, “in nature, nothing exists alone.” This project has inspired us to think more deeply about our relationships with each other, our devices, and the planet, and we hope it can inspire others to do the same. But our speculative design does not address the systemic changes that needs to happen for a more sustainable future. Because of this project, we will think more critically about the role of our designs in a broader movement towards humane and sustainable systems.</p>
