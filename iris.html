            <p class="content-center">Collaborator: Nini Nguyen</p>
            <p class="content"><i>This project was created for the Adobe x New York Times Creative Jam of September 2021 over the course of 2 weeks. The brief stated: “Your challenge is to design a user-centric mobile-first experience that increases trust and credibility in election content, in some way, for readers. Consider a visual or functional experience that confirms that news, polls, and outcomes are trustworthy to users.”</i></p>
            <p class="content">Inspired by the Greek messenger goddess Iris, the unbiased purple of iris flowers, and the shape of the eye's iris to represent clarity, we designed a one-stop for election news which filters and presents content based on its reliability. In one week we aimed to capture the most useful functions for potential users by interviewing others and focusing on the concepts and structures of our design, before creating its visual appeal. Our main goal was to create an interface that inspired confidence and trust in users. This was the first UI/UX project for both me and my collaborator.</p>

                    <p>The target users of our app are voters in the United States who need a quick and easy way to get the most reliable and recent news on their mobile device. With the common circulation of left- and right-wing biases in the United States media, we wanted to understand how people perceive the political spectrum. Although there is much more complexity in politics than identifying someone or something as Republican or Democrat, our interviews revealed that most people perceive American politics in red and blue, and that there a preconceived notions about sources, politicians, journalists, and other aspects of media and content. Understanding these user perceptions was an important step in our design, as it allowed us to explore the implications of various media presentations.</p>

                <p>We initially considered the use of a blue and red color scheme to give visual indications of the political slants in election content; however, we considered the polarizing consequences of such a design, and that a healthier view of election content may not be one that feeds into the left/right biases, while still analyzing them at face value.</p>
                <p>This realization allowed us to prioritize reliability scores that analyzed the source, author, sponsor, and content of the news without presenting it in a polarizing way that encourages pre-existing biases. We wanted our app to say, “Hey, this is what our analysis revealed in terms of reliability, but we encourage you to think critically about this content from your own perspective as well.” So, rather than filtering our unreliable news completely or presenting it on the red/blue spectrum, we settled on an unbiased purple color scheme that shows the most recent and reliable news at the top of the feed, and unreliable news later in the feed (above). The reliability scores are presented in an iris shape with each piece of content. We think that it is valuable to give users a baseline score and invite them form their own opinions, instead of the interface suggesting what they should think.</p>

                    <p>Continuing our consideration of content presentation, we opted to divide the election content based on the area in which the user was registered to vote or that in which they were most interested. This primary location divided news into three tabs: local, state, and national news (below). This way, the content on Iris was personalized to the user, but they were also able to explore news from other areas with the fourth explore page (left).</p>
                    <p>Once media presentation and overall layout of Iris had been determined based on the interviews we conducted, we were able to focus on the app's visual appeal.</p>
