                <p>Airpals is a B2B courier service startup in NYC, for NYC professionals. The company aims to provide a friendly and efficient service, of which their website is the primary touchpoint. Utilizing moderated remote user testing methodology, this project evaluates the usability of Airpals' order flow on its website. User feedback and data from this study informed recommendations for improvement to the site. Participants rated the overall user experience positively, but we found 6 ways to improve clarity and efficiency within Airpals' order flow.</p>

                <p><a href="https://airpals.co">Airpals</a> is a B2B courier service in New York City. As a relatively new startup (as of 2023), the company is still striving to expand its user base and improve its service and interface functionality. Their website allows users to submit an order for parcel pick-up and drop-off, meaning a seamless website experience is crucial. With the competitive and fast-paced market in NYC to consider, Airpals is invested in providing an efficient courier service to its customers.</p>

                <p>As a B2B service, Airpals users are primarily business operational professionals, and the company focuses on those in creative industries. Using customer analytics, personas, and other materials provided by the client, we developed a target user profile for recruitment and a questionnaire to assess the fit of potential participants.</p>

                <h3 class="h3-design">We faced the challenge of simulating the entire order flow in a single task</h3>
                <p>The order form composed the primary task that participants would be required to complete during testing because it is the central element to the site experience.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="callout">
                <h3 class="callout-h">The Task</h3>
                <p class="callout-p"><i>Locate and complete the order form to send a package to me with delivery on the next business day. Think about the last package you sent or one that you've sent before when filling out the form details.</i></p>
            </div>
            <div class="text-full">
                <p>Once the task was written, <b>our team faced the challenge of how to realistically capture the ordering experience without providing too much guidance to participants.</b> It was necessary to provide users with fake credit card and log-in information. We also needed to provide drop-off and recipient information, and have pick-up and sender information at the ready in the case that a participant wanted to keep their own address and phone number private. With us acting as moderators and recipients during the tests, we were able to strike a balance between providing necessary information and avoiding an excess of guidance that would skew the results.</p>

                <h3 class="h3-design">We adapted our recruitment strategy to achieve a representative sample</h3>
                <p>As we gathered information about our participants during testing, we realized that some were not an ideal fit for the user profile we initially defined.</p>
                <p>We believe this mismatch is a result of a vaguely worded question in our recruitment questionnaire: “Do you ever need to send things or have things delivered to you via a third party service within NYC for work?” Some interpreted this to mean sending materials digitally, which in itself does not qualify a participant. <b>This proved to be an important learning experience for recruiting representative samples and growing comfortable with the unexpected in research.</b></p>
                <p>We ultimately removed the data from those participants that did not fit the target group, and sought out a couple more participants via personal connections and recommendations from previous participants. A total of 8 sessions informed our findings and recommendations in the end.</p>

            <div class="text-left-narrow extra-margin">
                <h4>Recommendation 1: Streamline the questions about the parcel</h4>
                <p><b>Problem:</b> Participants felt that there were too many questions regarding the parcel details, and that the questions were unclear. For example, none of the participants understood where to specify handling instructions, and all omitted this information from their orders.</p>
                <p><b>Solution:</b> Our solution features a more concise page that focuses on only the parcel details. Pick-up and drop-off instructions were relocated, as they relate to origin and destination rather than the package itself (see recommendation #2). Questions about the parcel were disambiguated with subtext to clarify what information is needed. Dimensions were also added to the parcel size categories for additional clarity.</p>

            <div class="text-left-narrow extra-margin">
                <h4>Recommendation 2: Clarify pick-up and drop-off instructions</h4>
                <p><b>Problem:</b> Participants expected sender, recipient, and pick-up/drop-off information to appear alongside address selection. Half of the participants skipped pick-up and drop-off notes due to confusion about what to input.</p>
                <p><b>Solution:</b> Our recommendation is to consolidate all questions regarding the pick-up and drop-off locations, including the sender and recipient names, onto one page.</p>

            <div class="text-left-narrow extra-margin">
                <h4>Recommendation 3: Expand time selection options</h4>
                <p><b>Problem:</b> 4 of 8 participants felt that the time options were too limited, and the default drop-off of 8PM was too later after normal working hours. Time selection was also missing crucial affordances for changing the values.</p>
                <p><b>Solution:</b> The interface should have clearly clickable time selection areas that have more options within normal business hours.</p>

                <h4>Recommendation 4: Reinforce user control for editing</h4>
                <p><b>Problem:</b> Participants who tried to edit their form entries from the final page were redirected to the first page of the form, regardless of which page they selected to edit.</p>
                <p><b>Solution:</b> Users should be able to navigate directly to the page in the order form that they would like to edit.</p>

                <h4>Recommendation 5: Increase error salience</h4>
                <p><b>Problem:</b> 3 of 8 participants failed to notice error messages within the form.</p>
                <p><b>Solution:</b> We recommend making error messages more visible by increasing font size and weight, and highlighting the field which contains an error. This would prevent confusion and help users fix mistakes more quickly.</p>

            <div class="text-left-narrow extra-margin">
                <h4>Recommendation 6: Make address selection more flexible</h4>
                <p><b>Problem:</b> The address fields behaved unpredictably if a participant did not select an address from the drop-down. All participants copied and pasted at least one address into the fields, only to find that it disappeared if not also selected from the drop-down.</p>
                <p><b>Solution:</b> The form should display a clear error message in the event that an address is not selected from the drop-down. This communicates to users that the address fields function uniquely compared to the other form fields, while maintaining the proper formatting for the drop-down.</p>

                <p>This project allowed me to further develop my communication skills, both with my teammates and with the client team. Through some failed communication attempts during this project, I gained valuable experience in how to manage client expectations from the beginning. The biggest challenge our team faced was recruitment: because we had a vague question in our screening questionnaire, we spent valuable time testing participants that ended up not fitting our target user group. In future projects, I will be more aware and cautious about how questions should be worded to avoid misunderstandings and gather a representative sample. We were able to adapt after realizing our error, and still collected enough data to make informed recommendations. Learning to adapt was also a valuable experience from this study.</p>
